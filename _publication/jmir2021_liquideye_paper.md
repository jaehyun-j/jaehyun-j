  Background:

  Prolonged time of computer use increases the prevalence of ocular
  problems, including eye strain, tired eyes, irritation, redness, blurred
  vision, and double vision, which are collectively referred to as
  computer vision syndrome (CVS). Approximately 70% of computer users have
  vision-related problems. For these reasons, properly designed
  interventions for users with CVS are required. To design an effective
  screen intervention for preventing or improving CVS, we must understand
  the effective interfaces of computer-based interventions.


  Objective:

  In this study, we aimed to explore the interface elements of
  computer-based interventions for CVS to set design guidelines based on
  the pros and cons of each interface element.


  Methods:

  We conducted an iterative user study to achieve our research objective.
  First, we conducted a workshop to evaluate the overall interface
  elements that were included in previous systems for CVS (n=7). Through
  the workshop, participants evaluated existing interface elements. Based
  on the evaluation results, we eliminated the elements that negatively
  affect intervention outcomes. Second, we designed our prototype system
  LiquidEye that includes multiple interface options (n=11). Interface
  options included interface elements that were positively evaluated in
  the workshop study. Lastly, we deployed LiquidEye in the real world to
  see how the included elements affected the intervention outcomes.
  Participants used LiquidEye for 14 days, and during this period, we
  collected participantsâ€™ daily logs (n=680). Additionally, we conducted
  prestudy and poststudy surveys, and poststudy interviews to explore how
  each interface element affects participation in the system.


  Results:

  User data logs collected from the 14 days of deployment were analyzed
  with multiple regression analysis to explore the interface elements
  affecting user participation in the intervention (LiquidEye).
  Statistically significant elements were the instruction page of the eye
  resting strategy (P=.01), goal setting of the resting period (P=.009),
  compliment feedback after completing resting (P<.001), a mid-size popup
  window (P=.02), and CVS symptom-like effects (P=.004).


  Conclusions:

  Based on the study results, we suggested design implications to consider
  when designing computer-based interventions for CVS. The sophisticated
  design of the customization interface can make it possible for users to
  use the system more interactively, which can result in higher engagement
  in managing eye conditions. There are important technical challenges
  that still need to be addressed, but given the fact that this study was
  able to clarify the various factors related to computer-based
  interventions, the findings are expected to contribute greatly to the
  research of various computer-based intervention designs in the future.
